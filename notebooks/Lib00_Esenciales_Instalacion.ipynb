      "# Instalando IPython\n",
      "\n",
      "Si instalaron Python siguiendo las instrucciones proporcionadas, ya deben tener todos los componentes necesarios para ejecutar las libretas de IPython Notebook.\n",
      "There are a number of ways to install IPython Notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using OS X or Windows, we recommend you download and install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html), which is a free bundled installer of Python together with many other useful tools (including IPython Notebook.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Anaconda is a fairly large (around 300Mb) download so if you're at a workshop event we'll have some USB keys with the predownloaded installers to save on bandwidth**\n",
      "\n",
      "Anaconda comes with its own version of Python 2.7, IPython Notebook, plus other libraries like matplotlib and a package manager (\"conda\") that you can use to install other packages or other Python versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using Linux, Anaconda is available as an option but we recommend you try to install the programs using your Linux distribution instead (see under \"Alternative Options\", below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Alternative Options\n",
      "\n",
      "**This section is only if you don't want to or can't use Anaconda**\n",
      "\n",
      "Anaconda (described above) is the easiest option for this workshop. There are some other installer options that you can test out if you'd like to try something different:\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you're on Linux, most package managers include IPython Notebook. For instance on Ubuntu or Debian:\n",
      "\n",
      "        sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook python-matplotlib\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you have 'pip' installed (maybe from another OTS workshop) then you may be able to install IPython by itself (plus matplotlib) via 'pip', as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "        pip install ipython[notebook]\n",
      "\n",
      "(If you're on OS X you may need Xcode to compile dependencies.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you can't get IPython Notebook to work on your computer at all, there's a hosted service called [Wakari](https://www.wakari.io/) that you can use for free. In this case your programs won't be running on your own computer, they'll be running \"in the cloud\" (i.e. on Wakari's servers somewhere else) and you'll just see the results in your web browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Note about Python 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Anaconda and some of the other installers come with Python version 2. You may have been using Python version 3 up until now, this is the version that the Introduction to Programming workshop encourages you to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Python world is slowly migrating towards using Python 3 for everything. IPython is available for both 2 & 3, but Anaconda comes with Python 2 as it includes some components which are still Python 2 only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2 and Python 3 have some minor incompatible differences in language syntax. The programs shown in this workshop are designed to work with both, but if you find some code that doesn't work (but perhaps works on your neighbour's computer) then this may be why."

      "\n",
      "On Windows with Anaconda this directory is called \"IPython Notebooks\" inside \"My Documents\", and is created when you install Anaconda. On OS X, Linux or other Windows installations it's up to you which directory you use.\n",

      "\n",

      "## Loading Notebook Files\n",

      "\n",
      "## Loading Python Files\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "    %run \"myprogram.py\"\n",

      "\n",
      "* In previous workshops we used `help()` to view help information in the Python interpreter. IPython Notebook makes this even simpler, you can just type the name of a Python function or module and end it with a `?`. Try it now, type `range?` into a cell and run it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Using a nifty tool called NBViewer you can easily share IPython Notebooks on the internet, rendered as web pages (but still downloadable to play with in IPython.) Check out the [NBViewer home page](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) or the [IPython Notebook gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks) for some interesting ones.\n",

      "\n",
      "Other options if you feel like exploring:\n",
      "\n",
      "* There is a command line \"ipython\" program (just run `ipython` without the --notebook argument) that behaves similarly to the \"python\" interactive shell, but with some of the nice features of IPython Notebook (although none of the graphical features.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* There is a graphical IPython program (ie not web browser based) called \"IPython QtConsole\". It's like the command line IPython but with some graphical features. Launch this one by running `ipython qtconsole`.\n",
