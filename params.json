{"name":"Python Notebooks talk at ZaPyCon 2013","tagline":"Diving into the IPython, Notebooks and the scientific stack","body":"The IPython notebook and the Python science stack\r\n---\r\n\r\n[IPython](http://ipython.org/) in action creating reproducible and publishable interactive work.\r\n\r\nWhat is this\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis repo contains the full [talk](http://za.pycon.org/talks/10/) at [PyConZA2013](http://za.pycon.org/)\r\n\r\n[The Complete Talk GitHub Website can be accessed here][6]\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-------------\r\nIPython had become a popular choice for doing interactive scientific work. \r\nIn addition to this IPython offers a web based Notebook that makes interactive work much easier.\r\nNotebooks have been used to write repeatable science papers and more recently a book has been published using this platform, the online Notebook Viewer and GitHub.\r\n\r\nCombining the most common science packages with IPython makes it a formidable tool and serious competition to R. ( _R is still awesome!_ )\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact you can run R in the notebook session, embed YouTube Videos, Images and lots more.\r\n\r\nThe science stack consists of (but not limited to):\r\n\r\npackage  |  description\r\n---  |  ---\r\n[pandas][1]  |  `dataframe` implementation (based on numpy)\r\n[scipy][2]  |  efficient numerical routines\r\n[sympy][3]  |  `symbolic mathematics`\r\n[matplotlib][4]  |  python standard `plotting` package\r\n[sci-kit learn][5] | machine learning and `well documented!`\r\n\r\nTalk contents\r\n--------\r\nThe talk will aim to introduce these tools and give some practical examples. Once completed it will be shown how easy it is to publish your work to :\r\n\r\nitem   | description\r\n---- |  -------\r\nipython | quick intro to ipython and the notebook\r\nsetup  | set up your environment / get the talk files\r\nnotebook basics | navigate the notebook\r\nnotebook magics | special notebook commands that can be very usefull\r\ngetting input   | as from IPython 1.00 getting input from sdtin is possible\r\nlocal files | how to link to local files in the notebook directory\r\nplotting\t| how to create beautifull inline plots\r\nsymbolic math | quick demo of sympy model\r\npandas  | quick intro to pandas dataframe\r\ntypsetting | include markdown, Latex via MathJax\r\nloading code | how to load a remote .py code file\r\ngist         | paste some of your work to gist for sharing\r\njs\t\t| some javascript examples\r\ncustomising | loading a customer css and custom matplotlib config file\r\ngit cell    | add code to a special cell that would commit to git\r\noutput formats | how to publish your work to html, pdf or jeveal.js presentation\r\n\r\n\r\nGet the talk files here\r\n------\r\nformat  | description\r\n------- | ------------\r\n[IPython notebook](https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb)  |  .ipynb file to run in browser\r\n[IPython html notebook](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython.html) | converted to HTML and served online\r\n[IPython pdf notebook](https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython.pdf?raw=true)  | converted to PDF for download (to be added, needs pandoc)\r\n[IPython pdf book](https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/finaldoc.pdf?raw=true)  | converted to pdf and frontpage stitched to it)\r\n[Ipython reveal.js presentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython.slides.html#/) | converted to a reveal.js presenation and served online\r\n[Online IPython NBveiwer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb)  | view on the ipython notebook viewer\r\n\r\n\r\nSome interesting links\r\n-----------------------\r\n* [A book written with IPython Notebook][7]\r\n* [Notebook Viewer][8]\r\n* [Anaconda - Installing almost everything you need][9]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the presenter\r\n----------\r\n* I am an Electrical Engineer and is currently working for a [consulting firm][10] where I manage the Business Analytics and Quantitative Decision Support Services division.\r\n* I use python in my day to day work as a practical alternative to the limitations of EXCEL in using large data sets.\r\n* [LinkedIn][11]\r\n* I am also a co-founder at [House4Hack][12]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://pandas.pydata.org/\r\n  [2]: http://www.scipy.org/\r\n  [3]: http://sympy.org/en/index.html\r\n  [4]: http://matplotlib.org/\r\n  [5]: http://scikit-learn.org/\r\n  [6]: http://tooblippe.github.io/zapycon2013_ipython_science\r\n  [7]: http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/\r\n  [8]: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/\r\n  [9]: http://www.continuum.io/downloads\r\n  [10]: http://www.eon.co.za/index.php/our-services-main/our-services/business-analytics\r\n  [11]: http://www.linkedin.com/in/tobienortje\r\n  [12]: http://www.house4hack.co.za/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
