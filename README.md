The IPython notebook and the Python science stack
---

[IPython](http://ipython.org/) in action creating reproducible and publishable interactive work.

What is this
------

This repo contains the full [talk](http://za.pycon.org/talks/10/) at [PyConZA2013](http://za.pycon.org/)

[The Complete Talk GitHub Website can be accessed here][6]

Description
-------------
IPython had become a popular choice for doing interactive scientific work. 
In addition to this IPython offers a web based Notebook that makes interactive work much easier.
Notebooks have been used to write repeatable science papers and more recently a book has been published using this platform, the online Notebook Viewer and GitHub.

Combining the most common science packages with IPython makes it a formidable tool and serious competition to R. ( _R is still awesome!_ )

As a matter of fact you can run R in the notebook session, embed YouTube Videos, Images and lots more.

The science stack consists of (but not limited to):

package  |  description
---  |  ---
[pandas][1]  |  `dataframe` implementation (based on numpy)
[scipy][2]  |  efficient numerical routines
[sympy][3]  |  `symbolic mathematics`
[matplotlib][4]  |  python standard `plotting` package
[sci-kit learn][5] | machine learning and `well documented!`

Talk contents
--------
The talk will aim to introduce these tools and give some practical examples. Once completed it will be shown how easy it is to publish your work to :
